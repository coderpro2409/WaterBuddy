# WaterBuddy
## Issue
Water is an essential part of living beings. Human body is said to be comprised of more than 70% of water. However, in the present era of 21st century, where commercial and professional working is an important part of surviving, we often forget to drink water to the extent we should ideally drink. This can cause many effects, for example, fatigue, dehydration, and even fatal consequences in rare cases. Moreover, the fatigue can also mean lower productivity for the organization for which the individual is working for. This is highly against the concept of sustainability and balance.
## Introduction
This is an app, built specifically for kids and working professionals who tend to forget drinking water because of either the workload and stress, or the playing...

We have taken certain measures for the better optimization of water intake

### AI-Based Water Intake Target Recommendations
When the user selects his/her age-group and gender, our app provides AI-Powered Recommendations for the ideal water intake goal for the specific day.
#### User's Limit
However, we also consider that the user might be comfortable drinking less water, or might even be habituated with drinking more water daily, in comparison to the AI-based recommendation. Therefore, we allow the user to select their daily water intake target based on their preference, starting from 250 ml and ending at 5000 ml (5 lit.) with a gap of 250 ml (250,500,750,...,5000)
#### Sleep Time
For calculating the timings of the reminders, we request the user to select their sleep hour and sleep minute, with sleep meridien (AM/PM) for facilitating the process
#### 30-mins Prior
Sleep is very important for both health and productivity. Disturbance in sleep-cycle is not good.
We understand that drinking water just before sleep time can lead to the user waking up in between sleep for urination. So for the user's better sleep, we adjust the timings of the reminders such that the last reminder is atleast 30 minutes prior the sleep time selected by the user, giving an enough time of 30 minutes to the user for urinating before sleep, thus ensuring better sleep.
#### 30-mins Interval
Drinking 250 ml of water at a short time period (5 or 10 mins, for example) may lead to problems like Hyponatremia, Brain swelling, Heart strain, Kidney overload, Electrolyte imbalance, Frequent urination, Sleep disruption, Digestive dilution, and Peripheral swelling and lot more. This concludes that not only under-drinking, but also over-drinking can be harmful.
We believe in user's safety. Hence, we do not provide water drinking recommendations and warn the user that the app suggests to come back the next day to start the journey, instead of drinking all the water in a short period of time.
#### Maximum Sleep Time
It's not just about drinking water to sufficient level. Health is also determined by our sleep-cycle as mentioned earlier.
Hence, the app does not provide solutions for sleep time after 12:00 AM (Midnight) and it encourages the user to come back the next day for starting the journey.
#### Track Record
Sometimes, it might be that the user forgot whether he/she has clicked the button of +250 ml or not. So for better track, the app also shows the track record of when the user had drunk water.

## Procedure
#### Details Page
This page serves the purpose of fetching user details. The following details are asked by the interface - Name (Any), Age-group (6-12, 13-18, 19-30, 31-50, 50+), Gender (Male/Female), Sleep Hour (1,2,3,...,12), Sleep Minute (0,1,2,3,...,59), Sleep Meridien (AM,PM), Water Target ml: Ideally suggested {AI-Based water target according to age and gender} (250,500,750,...,5000)
Nothing more, just click the button "Start your Journey", and this will lead you to the next page.
#### Dashboard Page (Main)
This page, as the name suggests, serves the purpose of dashboard. It includes the greeting to the user by name, water target, water consumed, progress (in percentage as well as progress bar), button for +250 ml, list of upcoming reminders, track record of water intake and timings, and a check for reminders.
Follow the journey and wait till it ends, redirecting you to the last page, the congratulations page.
#### Congratulations Page
Once the water goal is achieved, nothing else. CONGRATULATIONS for sticking to the goal!
The page congratulates you with balloons! Also, it shows you the track record of the water intake and their respective timings again.
If you want to start the next day, just click on the button "Start Fresh Tomorrow", and you are on the square-one again! Once more!
## One more thing...
Do, Finish, Repeat. Follow this till life-long. We will hope to see you again with better features of the app. Till then, BYE BYE!

Best Regards,
WaterBuddy
